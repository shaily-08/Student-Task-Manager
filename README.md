Project title:- Student Task Manager

Project Goal:- A simple full-stack web application that allows students to add and view homework tasks.

Setup Instructions:-  
Open the project in an IntelliJ Idea
Run `TaskmanagerApplication.java`
Open a browser and go to:
   `http://localhost:8080`

The Logic:- 
Approach: Spring Boot with SQLite was chosen to keep the application simple, fully local, and within the given constraints.  
Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to build a lightweight Single Page Application.

Finding Bug & Fix: The main challenge was configuring SQLite with Spring Boot.  
This was resolved by adding the correct SQLite JDBC dependency,and database configuration.

Future improvements:-
With more time, I would add update and delete functionality and improve ui.
